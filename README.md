# Getting Started with the .NET MAUI Maps Control

A quick-start project that helps you to integrate a MAUI Maps control in a .NET MAUI application. This project contains code to load shapes from a remote file, bind a data source for a shape layer, load a map in a tile layer, and enable basic features like data labels, markers, legends, and tooltips.

## Project prerequisites
Make sure that you have the compatible versions of [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ ) and [.NET Core SDK 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) or later version in your machine before starting to work on this project.

## How to run this application
To run this application, you need to first clone the `getting-started-with-the-dotnet-maui-maps` repository and then open it in Visual Studio 2022. Now, simply build and run your project to view the output.

## Features and Benefits

## Shape layer

Render GeoJSON or shapefile data into custom maps or geographical area shapes on a shape layer for powerful data visualization. Customize the maps to the desired look using built-in options.

## Tile layer

An interactive tile layer allows you to load and customize map tiles from web map-tile services such as OpenStreetMaps, Bing Maps API, Google Maps Tile API, TomTom, Mapbox, Esri's ArcGIS. Use markers to denote a specific latitude and longitude in the tile layer as required. Zoom and pan the tile layer to navigate across the regions and take a closer look.

## Data labels

Data labels in a shape layer provide basic information about shapes by displaying their names and more. If required, trim or hide the labels when they exceed the shape bo

## Selection

Highlight a shape to focus attention to a specific area. Use this functionality to navigate  pages and show detailed information about a selected area.
